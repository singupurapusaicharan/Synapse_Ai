## 🧰 Tech Stack

### Frontend

* **Framework:** React 18 with TypeScript
* **Build Tool:** Vite (fast HMR, optimized builds)
* **Styling:** Modern CSS / utility-first patterns
* **State Management:** Lightweight, predictable state patterns
* **Routing:** React Router (if enabled)

### Tooling

* ESLint (code quality)
* Prettier (formatting)
* Jest / Testing Library (testing)
* Optional CI with GitHub Actions

---

## 🏗 Architecture

### System Design

```text
Client Layer
React + TypeScript + Vite
│
├─ Components (UI building blocks)
├─ Pages (route-level views)
├─ Hooks (reusable logic)
├─ Services (API adapters)
├─ Types (TypeScript contracts)
└─ Utils (shared helpers)
```

### Design Principles

* **Single Responsibility:** Each component does one thing well
* **Composition over Inheritance:** Flexible, reusable UI patterns
* **Strong Typing:** Explicit contracts for data and APIs
* **Scalability First:** Structure supports long-term growth
* **Performance Aware:** Lazy loading and optimized bundles
